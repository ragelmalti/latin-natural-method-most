            <h1>Useful information from the teachers manual</h1>
            <p>Contained on this page, is extracts from Fr Most's teacher's manual for the textbook, that I thought were important.
                The full teacher's manual (which I recommend you read), can be found on <a href="https://archive.org/details/most-william-latin-by-the-natural-method-teachers-manual">archive.org</a>.</p>

            <h2>Key principle: automatic habits:</h2>
            <blockquote><b>LEARNING A LANGUAGE IS REALLY LEARNING A SET OF HABITS.</b> Therefore, our principal
                and basic technique will be to develop habits. To develop a set of linguistic habits, it is necessary
                to have frequent , extensive contact with large quantities of matter that is never too difficult, relative 
                to a given stage of the student's development.</blockquote>
            <h2>How the student should prepare a passage:</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <ol>
                    <li>Let him read through a sentence or a group of sentences , trying to follow as much of the
                        thought as he can without translating, and without thinking of English. When he attempts this on
                        the first few days, of course he will not do it perfectly. But if he follows instructions it will
                        only be a few days before he is able to do much of it. One of the chief problems is to convince
                        him that such a thing is possible, that it can be done by very ordinary people, and is not reserved
                        for the unusually bright. We must drill into him, repeating it many times in the year, that little
                        Roman children before the use of reason could do this, that little natives of any country can do
                        it, that even morons in every country can do it.</li>
                    <li>If he has not understood fully, on this first reading, then let him translate. (The first year
                        book has all vocabulary on the margin. But later when he reads other books that do not have
                        marginal vocabulary, he must be warned NOT to begin by looking up words: so often a Latin word
                        has many meanings <u>which one is right can be determined only after one has the general
                        thought of the sentence.</u> Therefore it is dangerous to look up words too early -- try to guess,
                        and get as much as possible of the sense first). IF HE SIMPLY MUST (this is reserved for
                        emergency use only) let him look for and find: SUBJECT, VERB, OBJECT, in each clause, and
                        translate them IN THAT ORDER. If this procedure is followed , seldom will a student need to be
                        stalled on a difficult sentence . But it is emergency procedure only to use it regularly would
                        be to change to the "traditional" grammar - analysis approach.</li>
                    <li>But now the student has, by translating found the sense. Let him be sure it fits with the
                        sense of previous sentences.
                        But if he stops at this point, he has lost a great advantage: for he should next <b>REREAD THE
                        ENTIRE SENTENCE OR PASSAGE AT LEAST SIX TIMES</b>, trying constantly to follow without
                        thinking of any English words. At first, of course, he will find some trouble excluding English
                        words completely. Let him not worry about that, but persevere. After a while he will learn to
                        follow without thinking of English. Further, he will also learn to understand new, previously
                        unseen passages without translating. The reason for this rereading is plain: it is to form habits.
                        In this way the student becomes familiar with many patterns of structure, as well as vocabulary,
                        endings etc. It is the most efficient and natural way to learn all these things. When he has
                        reread many passages in this way, the student builds up a set of habits that operate automatically, 
                        without effort on his part. Only thus can he ever learn to handle the language with real
                        freedom. It is difficult to persuade some students to do this rereading. <u>Actual experience shows,
                        however, that even without rereading, students can do reasonably well, though not, of course,
                        nearly so well as if they had done it.</u></li>
