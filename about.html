            <h1>About this project</h1>
            <p>This website is an interactive web version of Fr William Most's "Latin by the Natural Method." 
                The functionality is based on the <a href="https://www.clc.cambridgescp.com/online-activities">'Explore the story' tool</a> for the Cambridge Latin Courses.</p>
            <p>Clicking on a Latin word gives it's definition in English. Other gramatical information is also presented, such as the declension of a word.
                This functionality is well suited for Fr Most's course, as his method for teaching the Latin language is through reading of the Latin text, with
                short gramatical explanations in English, as well as definitions of all new Latin words in English.
            </p>
            <p>Currently, I plan to adapt the first 5 lessons of Fr Most's volume #1 edition of the book, as a proof of concept.</p>
            <p>Fr Most has produced three volumes of his course, all of which are in the public domain, and can be found on archive.org:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/Latin_method_Most_1stYear">Volume #1</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/Latin_method_Most_2ndYear">Volume #2</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/Latin_method_Most_3rdYear">Volume #3</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/most-william-latin-by-the-natural-method-teachers-manual">Teacher's Manual</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since Fr Most's original work is in the public domain, I have decided to publish this website's source code under the Creative Commons Zero public domain licence.</p>
