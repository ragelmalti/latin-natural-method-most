            <h1>Foreword</h1>
            <p>On December 31, 1939, in the encyclical <i>On Education</i> 
                His Holiness Pope Pius XI wrote about the
                Christian teacher:</p>
            <blockquote>... in accepting the new, he will not hastily abandon
                the old, which the experience of centuries has found
                expedient and profitable. This is particularly true in
                the teaching of Latin, which in our days is falling more
                and more into disuse, because of the unreasonable rejection 
                of methods so successfully used by that sane
                humanism, whose highest development was reached in
                the schools of the Church.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
            <p>The thirteenth and sixteenth centuries were certainly
                eras when Christian humanism flourished. Also,
                methods of teaching are means to the objectives; and
                methods are naturally adapted as goals vary. Hence, the
                Holy Father's words clearly manifest his desire for a return
                to the objectives and methods of Latin teaching
                used with success in the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
                coupled with modern improvements.</p>
            <p>Precisely that is what is achieved by Father William
                G. Most's textbooks for teaching and learning Latin by
                "The Natural Method." They employ, not slavishly but
                with wise adaptation to changed modern circumstances,
                the objective (facility in using Latin as a means of communication) 
                and methods (habit formation by frequent repetition) used in 1250 or 1550. 
                They lead the student
                to reproduce the natural processes of habit formation by
                which Roman children learned Latin as their mother
                tongue. While doing this, the books do not discard the
                valuable training of mind, knowledge of grammar, and
                other benefits hitherto sought by Latin teachers of the
                twentieth century, but merely postpone their achieve
                ment until after the student has gained facility in using
                Latin. Also, they apply to the teaching of Latin many of
                the most effective techniques of teaching modern lan
                guages, and much that has been learned from the modern
                science called "descriptive linguistics." They are the first
                published American Catholic Latin textbooks which
                do all this.</p>
            <p>The great change in objectives and procedures of
                teaching Latin between the sixteenth and the twentieth
                centuries can be sketched here only with the utmost
                brevity.<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p>In the centuries of St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)
                and St. Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) virtually all
                education was imparted from Latin textbooks explained
                by oral Latin. The pupils learning Latin were almost entirely 
                between the ages of six and about fourteen.
                The chief objective of the teachers was to impart the art of
                reading, writing, and speaking Latin with facility, that
                it might be used as a means of communicating thought,
                or, in other words, as an indispensable tool in all higher
                studies and then in later life. They made extensive use of
                Latin conversation and of textbooks of easy Latin, such
                as dialogues, or "colloquia" about everyday life, the
                Pater, Ave, psalms, and Gospels. Thus by means of easy
                materials the teachers gave their pupils the copious practice 
                and repetition which alone develop a set of habits
                and that is the essence of learning a language success
                fully. The pupils, in truth, felt a sense of achievement
                in expressing their thought in a new language. Learning
                Latin was fun rather than drudgery. The Latin words
                directly evoked the ideas, not vernacular equivalents or
                grammatical nomenclature which was laboriously used
                to catch the ideas. Through mastering the threefold art
                of reading, writing, and speaking Latin the pupils automatically 
                acquired much training of mind and cultural
                knowledge. But nobody thought of setting up discipline
                of mind or cultural knowledge as the goal of Latin
                teaching. That goal was mastery of the art of using Latin
                with ease.</p>
            <p>This entire situation gradually changed from about
                1700 onwards. The vernaculars replaced Latin in text
                books and as the medium of instruction. As Latin more
                and more ceased to be necessary as the means of acquiring 
                and expressing learning, men were less and less
                motivated to study it, and its place in the curriculum
                continually waned. To defend it, especially after the
                times of John Locke (1632-1704) and Christian Wolff
                (1679-1754), the teachers pointed to the training of
                mind and the cultural knowledge it brought. Growing
                stress was put upon knowledge of Ciceronian style and
                grammatical analysis. In time, pupils began Latin not
                at the age of six but at fourteen. They learned declensions, 
                conjugations, rules of syntax, vocabulary lists,
                and grammatical nomenclature. Then, after 1890 in
                the United States, they decoded the long difficult sentences 
                of Caesar, and parsed the words. They repeated
                the process with a speech or two of Cicero and a few
                books of Vergil. They were acquiring knowledge about
                Latin, but not the art of using it with ease as a means of
                communicating thought. (Ability to read Latin at sight
                was ranked only in last place among the nineteen objectives 
                of Latin teaching listed by the teachers during the Classical Investigation of 1923.) 
                With most students the learning of Latin became drudgery rather than
                fun and a growing sense of achievement. Enrollments
                fell. In 1910, 49.05% of the American high school students 
                were taking Latin. By 1954, only 7% were study
                ing it (-1.3% in Alabama, 5.8% in Wisconsin, 16.4%
                in Connecticut).<sup>3</sup></p>
            <p>Most Americans who have studied Latin, with our
                priests and seminarians included, have employed this
                method, which they thought was "traditional." But as
                something fully developed, this tradition scarcely goes
                farther back than 1880; and even in its beginnings it
                hardly antedates the seventeenth century.</p>
            <p>In contrast to this method of grammatical analysis,
                Father Most's textbooks reproduce much of the "natural
                method" by which children learn their native language.
                Hence, the significance of Father Most's books is mani
                festly great for the Latin classes in any Catholic high
                schools or colleges. So much of our Catholic doctrine
                and culture have been deposited in Latin that we want
                many of our educated Catholics to be able to use Latin
                with ease.</p>
            <p>But the special significance of Father Most's texts is
                for the Latin classes in our seminaries. Here the students
                still have much the same cogent motives to master the
                art of using Latin with ease as the pupils of the thirteenth
                or sixteenth century. They need it as an indispensable
                means of communicating thought in their higher studies,
                and afterwards throughout life.
                The objectives (knowledge about Latin and training of mind) and correspono
                ing methods (grammatical analysis and translation)
                "traditional" since 1880 have taken over in our semi
                naries; and there too the students have been experienc
                ing an ever growing'inability to use Latin. Father Most's
                textbooks can contribute much towards revolutionizing
                the teaching of Latin by bringing back, as the chief
                objective, the art of reading, writing, and (when desired) 
                speaking Latin with ease. Thus they will help
                towards realizing not only the desires of Pope Pius XI
                cited above, but also those expressed by Pope Pius XII to
                the Carmelite Congress on September 13, 1951:</p>
            <blockquote>Alas, the Latin language, the glory of priests, now
                has rather few devotees, and even they are constantly
                languishing. . . . Let there be no priest who does not
                know how to speak and read it easily and quickly.
                Beyond this, may there arise among you some neither
                mediocre nor few who can write it even in a compressed 
                and elegant style of speech.</blockquote>
            <p>Towards the accomplishment of these lofty objectives, 
                our hope and prayer is that Father Most's important 
                textbooks using the "natural method" will have a
                wider and wider use.</p>
